# wiki_reader

This is a simple program that serves the function of returning the text of a wikipedia page with a given title.

This project is more of an exercise in project management; i.e. using **nose** for automated testing, **pipenv**/**virtualenv** for python environment management, **distribute** for package management.

Also used in this project is **mwclient**, a python library for interacting with the MediaWiki API (used here for accessing wikipedia pages)
